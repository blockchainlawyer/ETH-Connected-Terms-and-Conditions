<p class=MsoTitleCxSpMiddle>{company}</p>



<p class=MsoTitleCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoTitleCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoTitleCxSpLast>Preamble</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>{company} (the “<b>Company</b>”) is a limited liability

company established and organized under the laws of {country}. 

</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>The Company is identified by the following address

{company-address} on Ethereum network. Ethereum network is a public distributed

ledger that allows to deploy self-enforcing contracts called smart contracts

and provides global consensus of contract enforcement outcomes.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>The Company intends to enable its current and future

employees, freelancers, consultants and/or advisors (each an “<b>Employee</b>” for the purposes of this contract)

to participate in its commercial success. Therefore, it may offer its Employees

the opportunity to acquire options in shares in the Company. </p>



<p class=MsoNormal>This participation of the Employees in the Company shall

take the form of an Employee Share Option Pool (the “<b>ESOP</b>”) under the

terms and conditions as set out in a smart contract under address {esop-sc-address}

(the “<b>ESOP Smart Contract</b>”). The ESOP Smart Contract source code is

available in repository {repo-url} with commit {commit-id} (the “<b>Repository</b>”)

and steps to verify EVM bytecode can be found in README.md file.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>The ESOP terms outlined in this document (the “<b>Terms</b>”)

correspond to the self-enforcing computer code of ESOP Smart Contract. In the

event of any discrepancies between the ESOP Smart Contract and the Terms, the

Terms shall prevail. </p>



<p class=MsoNormal>The Terms define certain terms of conversion of Options (as

defined below). Such terms of conversion correspond to Base Options Conversion

Smart Contract the source code of which is available in the Repository. The

terms of conversion may be extended by an Options Conversion Smart Contract

which shall be derived from Base Options Conversion Smart Contract and shall be

offered to Employee.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>



<h1>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Acquisition of Options</h1>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The Company may offer options to the Employees (the “<b>Option-Offer</b>”).

The Option-Offer to the Employee will be made through a certain <b>Subscription

Form</b> provided by Company to Employee. The Subscription Form shall directly

interface to Ethereum network and shall allow Employee to sign ESOP Smart

Contract with Employee’s <b>Private Key</b>. Private Key storage (“<b>Wallet</b>”)

shall be at Employee’s sole discretion. However, no Option-Offer shall be made

before Employee’s <b>Ethereum Address</b> is provided to Company.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>{options-per-share} options provide the right to acquire one ordinary

share in the nominal amount of USD 1.00 (in words: Euro one) in the Company

(the “<b>Option</b>”) for the <b>Strike Price</b> of {strike-price} USD.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The Number of options granted to the Employee (“<b>Issued Options</b>”)

shall be determined by the algorithm pursuant to clause 2.1

and as further specified in the Subscription Form.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The Employee shall accept the Option-Offer through signing the ESOP

Smart Contract with Employee’s Private Key under the date (“<b>Issue Date</b>”)

as specified in the Subscription form.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.5<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Any Option-Offer may only be accepted until a certain date as specified

in the Subscription Form which shall not be earlier than two weeks after the

Option-Offer has been made to Employee. Once expired an Option-Offer shall

become void.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.6<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The granting of Issued Options does not have any influence on the

calculation of possible bonus payments, pension plans or any other

compensations of the Employee. The Company grants the Issued Options on a

voluntary basis only; the Employee is not entitled to demand further Options.

No repeated grant of Options to an Employee shall be deemed to confer any

entitlement (under any company practice or otherwise) as to any (future) grant

of Options to any Employee or any third person or entity. </p>

</span>Vesting Mechanism of Options</a></h1>



<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Ref481523605">2.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Options shall be issued pursuant to the following algorithm: Company

shall define a total number of “<b>Pool Options</b>” to be {pool-options} {the

“<b>Pool</b>”}. {new-employee-pool-share}% of total number of Pool Options in

the Pool shall be granted to Employee and then removed from the Pool. Each

subsequent beneficiary under the ESOP shall be offered

{new-employee-pool-share}% of the remaining options in the Pool .</a></p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Company may grant to Employee additional “<b>Extra Options</b>” subject

to its sole discretion (together with the Pool Options the “<b>Issued Options</b>”).

Such grant may be offered to Employee multiple times at any date before

Conversion Notification or Work Termination. </p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The Issued Options are subject to a vesting mechanism, i.e. an algorithm

determining the number of Issued Options qualified as vested options and only

as such becoming exercisable according to section 3 (the “<b>Vested Options</b>”).

The number of Vested Options shall be conditional on whether and when the

employment or service agreement between the Employee and the Company is terminated

or the Employee terminates working for the Company as a matter of fact (each a

“<b>Work Termination</b>”, the Employee in each case a “<b>Terminated Employee</b>”)

within a certain period of time after the Issue Date (the “<b>Vesting Period</b>”)

as specified in the Subscription Form. The remaining number of Issued Options

that will not become Vested Options or will be deemed not being Vested Options

(the “<b>Returned Options</b>”) shall return to the Pool.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The following methodology shall apply to determine the number of Vested

Options:</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.1<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>For a certain period commencing on the Issue Date (the “<b>Cliff Period</b>”),

as specified in the Subscription Form, no Issued Options shall become Vested

Options. </p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.2<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>For the period commencing with the end of the Cliff Period and until the

end of the Vesting Period, the number of Vested Options increases up to the

total number of Issued Options on a linear daily basis at the end of each

calendar day at the corporate seat of the Company starting with the Issue Date.

</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.3<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>In case of a Conversion Notification (as defined below) all Issued

Options shall be deemed Vested Options (the “<b>Accelerated Vesting</b>”) and

additional Bonus Options may be issued to Employee in a number as specified in

the Subscription Form. However, Bonus Options may only be granted if and when

at the date of the Conversion Notification no Work Termination has occurred and

only subject to Employee making further undertakings pursuant to clauses 3.4 and 3.6.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.4<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The expiry date of the Vesting Period, including the Cliff Period, shall

be extended for each and any calendar day which the employment, advisory or

service agreement of the Employee is suspended or during which the Company’s

obligation to pay a salary or any other compensation to the Employee is

suspended (for instance maternity leave, occupational disability, unpaid

sabbatical, illness, unpaid leave, exemption due to further education etc.) (a

“<b>Suspended Period</b>”).</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.5<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>For a certain period commencing at the date of the Work Termination (the

“<b>Termination Date</b>”) until a date that is the equal number of calendar

days after Termination Date as the Termination Date is after the Issue Date

(the “<b>Fade Out Period</b>”) , the number of Vested Options shall decrease

down to a number equaling a certain percentage of the Issued Options  as

specified in the Subscription Form (the “<b>Residual Amount</b>”) on a linear

daily basis at the end of each calendar day at the corporate seat of the

Company commencing with the Termination Date. </p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'>2.4.6<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The number of Pool Options that was decreased down during the Fade Out

Period shall deemed non-vested and shall return to the Pool as a Returned

Option.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.5<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Returned Options shall be granted to all Employees that participated in

the ESOP subsequent to the Terminated Employee {new-employee-pool-share}% of

total number of Returned Options shall be granted to the first such subsequent

Employee and removed from Returned Options. Each next subsequent Employee shall

be granted {new-employee-pool-share}% of the remaining options of Returned

Options. Any remaining Returned Option (if any) shall be returned to the Pool.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.6<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The Employee shall not be entitled to any Issued Options or Vested

Options if the employment, advisory or service agreement is terminated for

reasons for which the Employee is responsible (each case a “<b>Bad Leaver Event</b>”).

The Employee shall be regarded as responsible for any termination by the

Company for (good) cause. In a Bad Leaver Event the vesting mechanism shall not

apply and all Issued Options or Vested Options shall expire upon receipt of the

termination notice by the Employee or the Company, as applicable, without

entitlement to damages. </p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.7<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>If in any calculation involving options any given result is not evenly

divisible by one, it shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number if the

decimal fraction value is less than 0.5, otherwise it shall be rounded up. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>An “<b>Conversion Event</b>” is any kind of transaction including any

transaction under a smart contract in which (i) shares collectively

constituting more than 50 % of the Company’s issued share capital are

purchased, exchanged or acquired in a financially comparable fashion in one transaction

or a series of transactions temporarily connected by a buyer and/or buyer

consortium (each a “<b>Buyer</b>”) (the “<b>Share Purchase</b>”), and/or; (ii)

the Company sells all or nearly all assets and/or IP rights (defined as more

more shareholders’ rights in the Company under a Smart Contract, in particular

but not limited to voting rights and entitlements to dividends and “<b>ICO</b>”

shall mean the first offering of a certain token on a multilateral trading

platform operated as a distributed ledger. </p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Details of the options conversion mechanism shall be defined in Options

Conversion Smart Contract provided at the time of Conversion Notification. In

connection with the Options Conversion Smart Contract Company may extend, but

not limit the definition of “Conversion Event”.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

through <b>Options Conversion Form</b> which shall directly interface to

Ethereum blockchain. .</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Ref481523703">3.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The Options Conversion Form shall at minimum contain the following

provisions: (i) the number of the Employee’s Vested Options pursuant to section

</a>2; (ii) terms of a specific Conversion Event that shall be exercised via

Options Conversion Smart Contract; and (iii) <b>Accelerated Vesting and Bonus

Options Conditions</b>. The Conversion Offer may only be accepted within two

weeks after receipt if not provided otherwise in the Conversion Offer (the “<b>Exercise

Period</b>”).</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.5<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The Employee may only exercise the Vested Options within the Exercise

Period by providing information requested in the Options Conversion Form and

signing the Option Conversion Smart Contract with Employee’s Private Key.</p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Ref481523709">3.6<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>The Company is obliged to assign the Bonus Options and Vested Options

that are based on the Accelerated Vesting (together the “<b>Accelerated Options</b>”)

only subject to the Employee’s consent to Accelerated Vesting and Bonus Options

Conditions. Such conditions may include but are not limited to (i) offer to

continue working for the Company (the “<b>Continued Work</b>”) for a certain

period after the Conversion Event as defined in the Conversion Offer (the “<b>Post

Conversion Period</b>”) and (ii) consenting that proceeds resulting from the

Conversion Event allocated to the Accelerated Options (the “<b>Additional

Payment</b>”) is held fiduciary for him and placed in an escrow account and

only be released to the Employee (a) at the end of the Post Conversion Period

or (b) after a Work Termination has occurred within the Post Conversion Period

if such Work Termination is not due to a Bad Leaver Event. In all other cases,

the Employee shall not be entitled to the Additional Payment. If the offer to

provide Continued Work was declined by the Company or the Buyer, as applicable,

the Accelerated Options shall be treated as regular Vested Options.</a></p>



<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Ref481523721">3.7<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>If the Company fails to provide the Conversion Notification and the

Employee does not exercise his Vested Options before the Conversion Event, the

respective Options will be deemed exercised according to the Conversion Options

Smart Contract. Accelerated Options will be added to Vested Options. If and

when the Exit Event occurs, the Employee will then be entitled towards the

Company to a compensation payment in the pro rata amount of the total proceeds

of the Exit Event (less the Strike Price) that would have been allocated to the

shares that would have been assigned to him if he had exercised the Vested

Options.</a></p>

</span>If the Employee fails to exercise his Vested Options within the Exercise

Period, the Company shall have the right to exercise such Vested Options (the “<b>Company´s

Right and an Conversion Event occurs, the Employee will be entitled towards the

Company to a compensation payment in the pro rata amount of the total proceeds

of the Exit Event (less the Strike Price) that would have been allocated to the

shares that would have been assigned to him if he had exercised the Vested

Options. If the Company’s Exercise Right is not exercised section 3.8 shall not apply.</p>

</span>Any Issued Options are under no circumstances transferable without the

Company’s prior written consent. The same applies to measures or actions, which

economically correspond to such a transfer (for instance trust or

sub-participation). In case any Issued Options are transferred without the

Company’s prior permission, they shall expire without any right to damages. </p>
